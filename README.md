- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rockncoder
- 👀 I’m interested in Web and Mobile. Loving Flutter, SwiftUI, AWS Lambda, MongoDB, and DynamoDB
- 🌱 I’m currently working towards getting more certifications this year in AWS (6), Android, MongoDB, and Terraform.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now, maybe after I get all my certs.
- 📫 Find me on Twitter at @therockncoder.
