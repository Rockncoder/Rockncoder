- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rockncoder
- 👀 I’m interested in Web and Mobile. Loving Dart, JavaScript, Kotlin, Swift, and C++. Learning Rust and SwiftUI.
- 🌱 I’m currently working towards getting more certifications this year in AWS (6), and Android.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything right now, maybe after I get all my certs in 2023.
- 📫 Find me on Twitter at @therockncoder.
