- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rockncoder
- 👀 I’m interested in Web and Mobile. Loving Flutter, Kotlin and C++. Learning Rust and SwiftUI.
- 🌱 I’m currently working towards getting more certifications this year in AWS (6), and Android.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now, maybe after I get all my certs.
- 📫 Find me on Twitter at @therockncoder.
